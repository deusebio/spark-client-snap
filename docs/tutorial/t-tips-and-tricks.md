In the following, we summarize some common tips, tricks and gotchas to run smoothly Apache Spark on kubernetes, even in small local environments

* In case executor pods fail to schedule due to insufficient CPU resources, make [fractional](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#resource-units-in-kubernetes) CPU requests
